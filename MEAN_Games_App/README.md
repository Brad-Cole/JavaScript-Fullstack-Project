# MEAN Games App Project
Code Louisville Final Project 

Starting work on MEAN stack project for a webapp that will provide a database of NES games and let the user check off which ones they own and which ones they want.

If there is time left over I would like to add:
1. An API to ebay to get values 
2. Provide filtering and search options
3. Save locally so the user doesnt have to start over if they refresh the page
4. Advanced functionality for later would be to add a user login system so profiles can be accessed anywhere as well as support for other systems like SNES.
