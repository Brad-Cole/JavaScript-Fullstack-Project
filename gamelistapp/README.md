Node.js and MongoDB must be installed. GitBash or equivalent command line recommended.

From a command prompt navigate to gamelistapp directory then
	npm init 

from the same area do
	npm install

From a 2nd command prompt navigate to mongodb/bin directory then
	mongod

From a 3rd command prompt navigate to gamelistapp directory then
